### Hi, I'm Jerelle ðŸ‘‹

I am a research associate at the [Gulf of Maine Research Institute](https://gmri.org/). I work in the Quantitative Fisheries Research lab led by Dr. Lisa Kerr. My research focuses on simulation studies and management strategy evaluation (MSE) to improve fisheries stock assessment and management using a [frameowrk built for groundfish in New England](https://github.com/lkerr/groundfish-MSE).


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a prototype MSE for ecosystem based fisheries management in Georges Bank with the [Fay lab](http://www.smast.umassd.edu/lab_fay/).
- ðŸŒ± Starting my PhD at U Maine in fall 2023!
